                The script scans the descriptions directory for .txt files. For each file, it reads the first few lines and extracts relevant data: title, name, date, and feedback comments.

            Date Formatting
                The date string in the file is converted to a datetime object. If the date is in the correct format (YYYY-MM-DD), it is formatted and added to the JSON data. If not, the date is left as-is.

            JSON Data Creation
                The script creates a JSON object with the extracted information:

                {
                  "title": "Title of Feedback",
                  "name": "Name of User",
                  "date": "Formatted Date",
                  "feedback": "Feedback content"
                }

            POST Request
                The formatted JSON data is sent to the specified URL via an HTTP POST request using the requests.post() method.
                The serverâ€™s response status is checked, and feedback success or failure is logged to the console.

        Important Notes

            Server URL
                Ensure the URL (http://34.145.58.248/feedback/) is accessible and configured to accept the posted data. Update the url variable as needed.

            File Format
                This script expects .txt files with a specific structure. If your files differ, you may need to adjust the parsing logic.

            Date Handling
                The script assumes the date is in YYYY-MM-DD format. If other date formats are used, they may need to be handled separately.

        Potential Applications

            Feedback Collection: Automate the process of gathering and uploading user feedback to a server for analysis.
            Data Integration: Integrate with a backend system to store and manage feedback data.
            Batch Data Upload: Ideal for batch processing of large sets of text-based data and sending them to a server.
